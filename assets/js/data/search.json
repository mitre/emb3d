This initial release of EMB3D includes the Device Properties and Threats enumerations. The full set of Mitigations will be available in the Summer 2024 update.What is EMB3D&trade; EMB3D is a threat model for embedded devices found in industries such as critical infrastructure, Internet of Things, automotive, healthcare, manufacturing, and many more. The threat model is intended to be a resource to help vendors, asset owners/operators, test organizations, and security researchers to improve the overall security of embedded devices' hardware and software. This threat model aims to serve as a central repository of information, defining known threats to embedded devices and their unique device features/properties that enable specific threat actions. By mapping the threats to the associated device features/properties, the the user can easily enumerate threat exposure based on the known device features. Device Properties Device properties describe a device's hardware and software components and capabilities of a device. These include physical hardware, network services and protocols, software, and firmware. Each category is further divided into sub-properties that are then mapped to a set of threats. By mapping properties, users can identify the threats associated with a given device property. Threats EMB3D threats identify how a threat actor can achieve a specific objective or effect on a system or device. Each threat description includes (i) information about the technical features that are targeted by the threat; (ii) the actions that must be performed by the threat actor to cause the threat's effect, including the impact or effect the threat will have on the device; and (iii) the vulnerabilities or weaknesses within that mechanism that enable the threat actions. Mitigations Mitigation strategies and techniques are described for each threat. These can be leveraged by device vendors to prevent and reduce the risk of a threat, and by end users to validate that devices are sufficiently protected against that threat. The mitigations define the mechanisms or technologies that protect against the threat while remaining flexible in how mitigations can be implemented within the device's unique constraints. EMB3D Users Device Vendors Support device threat models and provide guidelines for mitigations requirements/designs. Develop device roadmaps for evaluating device risk and prioritizing mitigation efforts. Asset Owners & Operators Inform acquisition requirements and decisions about unmitigated threats/risks. Support acquisition efforts related to evaluating a device's security capabilities. Guide the development and deployment of compensating controls around unmitigated threats. Security Researchers/Testers Scope assessment activities and outcomes. Help identify potential trouble spots for deeper investigation. Contribute to research efforts around novel threats and mitigations. More Information Background Getting Started Whitepaper Contact Us © 2023-2024 The MITRE Corporation. All Rights Reserved.

Mapping these threats to device properties helps users develop and tailor accurate threat models for specific embedded devices. For each threat, suggested mitigations are provided for technical mechanisms that device vendors should implement to mitigate the given threat by building security into the device. EMB3D is a comprehensive framework for the entire security ecosystem — device vendors, asset owners and operators, security researchers, and testing organizations.A framework for a dynamic threat landscapeEMB3D is a living framework that will be updated with new threats and mitigations as security researchers discover new vulnerabilities, threats, and security defenses. EMB3D is a public, community resource where all information is openly available, and the security community can submit additions and revisions.More InformationWhitepaper" }, { "title": "Getting Started", "url": "/getting-started/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-05-13 08:33:15 -0400", "snippet": "Applying EMB3D™Step 1.

Enumerate device properties and map to threats First, identify the set of Device Properties List that apply to the device being evaluated based on device knowledge and documentation. While a vendor may be able to fully enumerate all properties, an asset operator or security researcher may need to review available documentation or perform initial device testing or decomposition to fully enumerate the relevant properties. Select the applicable properties in the Properties Mapper Tool to generate the list of Threats the device may be exposed to because it incorporates those properties and features. Properties to Threats MapperStep 2. Enumerate threats and evaluate their relevance/risk After identifying the device’s properties list and obtaining the candidate threat mapping, the next step is to review each potential threat to determine if it truly applies to the device and how much risk it poses. For additional details, follow the threat detail links output by the Mapper Tool or look up the associated Threat ID (TID) in the Threats catalog. Each threat description provides additional information about that threat, including its maturity level, documented threat evidence and CVEs, and associated weaknesses from the CWE database. This information helps to better understand the mechanics of the threat, its prerequisites, how it manifests on embedded devices, and how threat actors might utilize it, which can be used to better understand the risk of that threat to the device in question. Step 3. Identify required mitigations Equipped with a list of threats that pose a viable risk to the device, the next step is to determine if the device sufficiently defends against those threats. Coming in the next release of EMB3D in Summer 2024, each threat description will include a set of Foundational, Intermediate, and Leading mitigations. These mitigations will provide guidance on what technical mechanisms can best prevent or reduce the risk of that threat. Mitigations will include references to guidance documents and best practices, along with information about potential limitations and challenges when deploying each mitigation. The mitigation recommendations can then be used to make decisions and plans about the device. Device vendors may use the mitigations mapping to prioritize their security engineering efforts and choose technical security mechanisms that will be most effective against current and future threats. Asset owners and operators may use it to inform acquisitions, make judgements about the risks of devices deployed in their environments, or what additional environmental-level mitigations they wish to make to address residual risk. Finally, security researchers can use this information to organize and triage their efforts to determine which aspects of a device are worth deeper investigation.

This can include extracting secrets/keys, discovering operations conducted on sections of memory, and device control flow. A threat actor can therefore physically monitor the power consumption of a device during an execution of a cryptographic operation to create a trace of its power usage over time. By leveraging the understanding of the operations of common cryptographic properties, the power usage traces can be used to infer various information, such as the cryptographic keys.Threat Maturity and EvidenceProof of ConceptDifferential power analysis (DPA) and correlation power analysis (CPA) on Arduino Uno Researchers “demonstrate that both DPA and CPA techniques are viable in deducing the full 16-byte key of AES-128 by monitoring the power consumption of an Arduino Uno which implements the AddRoundKey and SubBytes steps in round 1 of AES.”CWECWE-1300: Improper Protection of Physical Side Channels (Base) “The device does not contain sufficient protection mechanisms to prevent physical side channels from exposing sensitive information due to patterns in physically observable phenomena such as variations in power consumption, electromagnetic emissions (EME), or acoustic emissions.”CWE-1255: Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks (Variant) “A device’s real time power consumption may be monitored during security token evaluation and the information gleaned may be used to determine the value of the reference token.”CVE" }, { "title": "TID-102", "url": "/threats/TID-102.html", "categories": "Hardware", "tags": "", "date": "2024-05-13 08:33:15 -0400", "snippet": "TID-102: Electromagnetic Analysis Side ChannelThreat DescriptionDevices will oftentimes emit different electromagnetic signals during different operations.

Hardware faults can be induced by various methods, including voltage fault injection (power glitching), electromagnetic pulses (EM glitching), and optical fault injection. Glitching can be used to bypass various security protections on a device, such as skipping a firmware integrity check during a secure boot process or protections against firmware or data read-out from the device. This threat requires physical access to the device to perform the glitching, and also typically requires substantial iterative testing to identify the precise nature, magnitude, and timing of signals that need to be injected to cause the glitch condition.Threat Maturity and EvidenceKnown Exploitable WeaknessGlitching the Switch In pursuit of extracting the 1st stage boot ROM code from the Nvidia Tegra X1 SoC, the researchers implemented a power glitching attack against the processor to prevent the bootloader from enabling the SoC’s readout protection for that code segment. The glitch interrupts the boot ROM code from writing to a security configuration register, leaving the processor in a state that allows exporting the code responsible for the establishing the processor’s root of trust for secure boot. Analysis of the bootloader code yielded an exploitable buffer overflow in a USB protocol implementation (see TID-327) used to inject code that bypasses secure boot and allows executing unauthorized firmware.

However, if the root of trust implementation is flawed, immutability prevents the revocation and replacement of compromised keys, and prevents patching vulnerable code. Therefore, if threat actors have access to a mechanism to obtain the secret data or code, and/or those secrets and code are shared over multiple devices and threat actors can obtain them, then devices will remain vulnerable past threat disclosure and may have to be removed from operation and replaced with new patched versions.Threat Maturity and EvidenceKnown Exploitable WeaknessGlitching the Switch The researchers show how they identified an exploitable flaw in the immutable 1st stage boot ROM code of the Nvidia Tegra X1 SoC, which the Nintendo Switch game console is built upon. The secret boot ROM code serves as the root of trust for secure verified boot on the Tegra X1 platform. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the recovery mode of the boot ROM allows a threat actor to bypass firmware verification and execute unauthorize custom or modified firmware on the device.

The code is encrypted in ECB mode without additional cryptographic authentication and integrity over the ciphertext as a whole.”OT-ICEFALL - CVE-2022-29955 “The BSAP/IP protocol uses weak encryption to transmit passwords.”OT-ICEFALL - CVE-2022-29960 “DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used to protect system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.”" }, { "title": "TID-412", "url": "/threats/TID-412.html", "categories": "Networking", "tags": "", "date": "2024-05-13 08:33:15 -0400", "snippet": "TID-412: Network Routing Capability AbuseThreat DescriptionSome devices will allow for the forwarding of packets to other connected devices (e.g., routing, port forwarding, tunneling, VPN).

If the device is used to forward or route communications, a threat actor could change the forwarding rules or routes. This feature could be used by the threat actor to either (i) disable required forwarding rules to prevent authorized communications or (ii) add new rules that allow unauthorized access to other devices. The threat actor could potentially use this to gain access to devices that are within protected networks or zones.Threat Maturity and EvidenceObserved Adversary TechniqueATT&amp;CK Technique: Connection Proxy (T0884) Procedure Example: Incontroller (S1045) “The INCONTROLLER PLCProxy module can add an IP route to the CODESYS gateway running on Schneider PLCs to allow it to route messages through the PLC to other devices on that network. This allows the malware to bypass firewall rules that prevent it from directly communicating with devices on the same network as the PLC.”CWECWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (Base) “The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.”CWE-15: External Control of System or Configuration Setting “One or more system settings or configuration elements can be externally controlled by a user.”CVE" } ]
