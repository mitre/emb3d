Failures of processor architectures to properly deliver these security guarantees can lead to sensitive information being disclosed across the boundaries between different kernel and process memory spaces. The performance optimization features in modern processors have been shown to be a source of such data leakage vulnerabilities.\n\nData leakage through timing-based side channels introduced by the behavior of processor features such as memory caches have long been known to be effective against cryptographic implementations. The Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities announced in 2018 brought attention to weaknesses in certain microarchitectural performance features that could be manipulated in conjunction with memory cache timing techniques to leak data across OS virtual memory bounds. Spectre / Meltdown, and subsequent research work, demonstrated that speculative execution features (e.g., branch prediction, speculative memory loads/stores, out-of-order execution, etc.) could lead to memory locations being read into the CPU\u2019s cache in violation of virtual memory permissions. Malicious code could then utilize a subsequent cache timing side channel attack to extract the data stored in those memory locations.\n\nSince the initial Spectre and Meltdown disclosure, researchers have explored timing-based side channels resulting from other CPU performance and power saving features, such as the Hertzbleed work that targets dynamic frequency scaling.\n\n<u>Consideration</u>: This class of attack requires a threat actor to have the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target device to both create the conditions for the data leakage and subsequently extract data.

            "description": "Certain software-executed attacks can introduce a fault to the physical hardware of the device, leading to greater access or exploit opportunities. Typically, these kinds of attacks involve performing a software action that would necessitate a predictable and controllable reaction in hardware. If this hardware action contains properties that allow for some kind of fault to occur, then the threat actor can inject the fault through software and try to leverage it into an exploit.\n\nFor example, the Rowhammer exploit demonstrates how repeated dynamic random access memory (DRAM) accesses can lead to a privilege escalation exploit. This exploit is possible through the combination of DRAM cells being placed very close together and attackers repeatedly accessing the same physical cells on the DRAM from software. This repeated access causes a leakage of electric charge within the memory, leading to a manipulation of the charge of nearby memory locations. This induced charge manipulation results in a manipulation of the contents of memory itself. By manipulating the contents of memory, the threat actor may be able to escalate privileges on a device or otherwise bypass security controls.\n\nAnother example of this is the Plundervolt exploit. In this attack, researchers demonstrated that users could use software to control the supply voltage of a secure enclave during computation, up to the point of introducing a fault in the processor itself. They were able to leverage this fault into a set of exploits where they could corrupt cryptographic signatures through voltage variability, extract cryptographic keys using differential fault analysis, or introduce memory safety vulnerabilities in otherwise bug-free code.",

            "description": "Under a software bootloader authentication scheme, the bootloader is authenticated using a software-based mechanism where the key, authenticated integrity measurement, and verification logic are stored within memory and the authentication is performed on a main/multipurpose processor. This performs boot-time integrity verification of the bootloader to ensure it was not previously modified or tampered with. Before a bootloader is executed, it should be authenticated by taking an integrity measurement (e.g., hash) of the bootloader, and verifying the hash against a stored signed integrity measurement stored in a bootrom.\u00a0A device may have multiple bootloaders which operate in multiple stages; therefore, this mitigation may need to be implemented and executed multiple times across the stages to ensure the integrity of each stage.\n\nLastly, authenticating the first and all subsequent bootloaders allows the device to build a chain-of-trust, through which a secure boot scheme can be made for the device. Secure boot schemes allow the device to use earlier-staged authenticated bootloaders to authenticate and launch subsequent bootloaders and software.\n\nBecause this mitigation stores the keys and authentication logic/mechanisms in memory and executes checks on the main CPU, this mitigation is vulnerable to key extractions (*TID-214: Secrets Extracted from Device Root of Trust*) and tampering with the authentication process (*TID-214: Inadequate Bootloader Protection and Verification*). To minimize this threat, the first stage of the bootloader that performs this check should be stored within ROM to prevent modification by possible malicious code injected at runtime.\n\n<u>Note</u>: This mitigation is in contrast to a hardware-based bootloader authentication scheme (*MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication*), where dedicated hardware is used to protect the key and authentication process.\n\n<u>Limitation</u>: A software-based bootloader authentication scheme can be bypassed if a threat actor is able to physically extract symmetric keys from storage, memory, or through side-channel analysis of the processor while the key is in-use. Additionally, if the device is using asymmetric encryption, these protections can be undermined by changing the hash of the public key or the public key itself stored on the device.",

            "description": "Building on the simpler *MID-009 - Operating System-based Runtime Integrity Check*, devices can go further and periodically take integrity measurements and send them out in remote attestation messages. These measurements can be implemented separately across multiple parts of the device stack, such as the bootloader, firmware, software, and application process level, and can include readings on bootloader integrity, device timing statistics, process and page-table integrity, and overall memory integrity. With a combination of all of this information, users can gain a reasonable sense of if the device\u2019s normal operations have been manipulated.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Periodic integrity measurements are the most valuable and trustworthy when a device has a secure operating environment in which to perform its measurement calculations and network encryption. The presence of these properties may however expose a device to threats related to *PID-41 - Device exposes remote network services*, *PID-4113 - Device includes cryptographic functions for sensitive data, such as encryption or authentication*, *PID-251 - Root of Trust is physically accessible or is not immutable*, or *PID-252 - Root of Trust is immutable*",

            "description": "Mechanisms to protect memory against code injection include restricting what parts of memory can execute code and randomizing address space to prevent the development of effective exploits.\n\nExecutable Space Protection and Write xor Execute (W^X) should be used to restrict what code can be executed in memory. Executable Space Protection uses either hardware or software features to mark memory as non-executable, thereby preventing injected code from being executed. W^X restricts a memory page from being both writable and executable, therefore, any memory that can be overwritten by a threat actor (W), cannot be executable (X).\n\nAddress space layout randomization (ASLR) is designed to reduce the predictability of memory addresses so that a threat actor cannot consistently find areas of memory that are able to be exploited or manipulated. This can be done across the application and kernel (KASLR) data spaces.\n\nLastly, program stack specific mitigations, such as stack canaries \\[5\\], safe/unsafe stack schemes \\[4\\], etc. can be used to detect or increase the difficulty of stack overwrite attacks.\n\nDevices should use a combination of the above classes of code and memory injection protections to give their device a more secure posture.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Some mechanisms that specifically address code injection can be bypassed by attacks that reuse existing code, such as return-to-libc and return-oriented programming (ROP).

This can greatly reduce attacks targeting memory bounding errors. Memory safety integration in a device can take multiple forms. Individual drivers, libraries, critical kernel functions, or applications should be implemented in memory safe programming languages. In other instances, it may be possible to use entire kernels or OSes written in memory safe programming languages.\n\n<u>Consideration</u>: Memory safe programming languages implement memory safety using different mechanisms. Based on a device\u2019s resources and properties, using one language over another may be desirable. For example, certain memory safe programming languages use more resources due to their runtime memory protections. These can include garbage collection, virtual runtime environments, and code interpreters. Languages that fall into this category are Java, Python, and Go. Other languages, such as Rust, use compile-time checks to handle address spacing mappings and frees.\n\n<u>Limitation</u>: Use of a memory safe language can help protect against a significant number of common vulnerabilities; however, it does not address every type of software weakness. For example, issues related to input validation, logic flaws, or deserialization can still occur in software written in memory safe languages.",

Examples include microkernel architectures and schemes that split some or all of a driver to run in user space vs within a monolithic kernel.\n\nDeploying drivers in a memory isolated context is an effective way of reducing the attack surface of an OS/Kernel because drivers are frequently handling I/O operations and external data, making them readily targetable. When drivers are not memory isolated, a vulnerability in one driver may enable a threat actor to move laterally to other drivers or OS/Kernel components, potentially giving them more access on a device. Memory isolation makes lateral movement more difficult.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Memory can likely never be fully separated due to a need for driver information to be handled by the system or applications running on the device. For this reason, the attack surface will never be entirely eliminated, and other protections, such as the usage of memory safe programming languages, could be put in place to further decrease the threat actor\u2019s attack surface.",

            "description": "One way to understand a protocol's complexity is through a computational theoretic perspective (e.g., LangSec). For example, the Chomsky hierarchical rank of the grammar used to create a protocol directly dictates the minimum computational model necessary to recognize and parse the protocol. Therefore, 1) structured data and protocols should be designed using the lowest level grammar possible so that 2) parsers can be made using minimally and appropriately matched computational models (e.g., a deterministic push-down automata being used to parse context free input languages instead of a Turing machine).\n\n**1. Regarding implementing your own protocol**\n\nThe design of any new protocol should include an understanding of the grammar used to create that protocol and the computational model necessary to parse that protocol to ensure that the language can be correctly represented by a decidable computational model, particularly with regard to the equivalence problem. This would mean building a protocol out of a regular or deterministic context-free grammar.\n\nUnless a protocol or input language can be built from a regular or deterministic context-free grammar, any corresponding parsers cannot be built to be recognizers and parsers of that protocol without being made undecidable with regard to the equivalence problem *and* maintain full protocol functionality. This is important because if a parser built to run over an undecidable grammar with regard to the equivalence problem, it will be impossible to guarantee that the parser does not enter an unwanted or vulnerable state. This makes the parser have a higher chance of exhibiting exploitable behaviors.\n\n**2. Regarding implementing your own parser**\n\nThe design of any new protocol parser should be made such that the computational model of that parser conforms to the minimally sufficient computational model necessary to parse that protocol. If a protocol parser is made to be more complex than the grammar used to make the protocol would otherwise require, threat actors may be able to discover unwanted or vulnerable states that could lead to exploitation. Minimally necessary computational models, ideally ones that are decidable with regard to the equivalence problem, allow for machine states to be checked and give threat actors less opportunities to exploit parser behavior.",

The operating system should verify the authenticity of those peripheral firmware packages as part of, or alongside, the checking the driver prior to loading them on the peripheral hardware (e.g., an FPGA, sub-component microcontroller, etc.)\n\nThis authentication scheme should be coupled with *MID-001- Software Only Bootloader Authentication* or *MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication*, where the device authenticates the bootloader and then leverages that trusted bootloader to verify all the drivers that are going to be run on the device.

            "description": "The OS should enforce access controls for all users and programs to prevent unauthorized access to OS resources, services, and system calls. There are numerous methods of restricting permissions and privileges to users and programs, including leveraging OS-based access control mechanisms that restrict OS system calls or sandbox-based approaches that encapsulate programs within restrictive environments. These mechanisms should be implemented to enforce access based on the principle of least privilege - which states that programs and users should only have access to the resources that they absolutely need to operate, and nothing else.\n\nOperating systems typically deploy various access control mechanisms that restrict which system calls can be executed and what resources those system calls can access. While many operating systems include a default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mechanism, these have limitations on their ability to define granular permissions for privileged functions. Strong access control mechanisms include (i) capabilities-based permission models, which provide more granular controls over privileged functions, or (ii) mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms (e.g., SELinux), which allow fully customizable privileges across all system calls and resources. Further, programs should obtain privileged access only for key functions and then downgrade those privileges after the function is performed (e.g., setuid/setguid). The access control mechanisms deployed by the device must be sufficiently sophisticated to support the variety of programs and applications, their exposure to threats (e.g., networks services), and the criticality of specific data or resources.\n\nOther mechanisms can be used to further restrict what resources an executing process may access. For example, in Linux the seccomp feature can be used to limit which of the OS kernel\u2019s system calls a process may invoke, further constricting the attack surface a compromised process can access to increase its foothold on a device.",

            "description": "Sandboxes are software execution environments that run code under restrictions to limit that code\u2019s access to system resources a non-restricted user-level process would otherwise have access to. This is especially useful when handling untrusted code provided by users (e.g., a PLC program) or 3<sup>rd</sup> parties (e.g., JavaScript from a remote web site), especially when supporting such code is a mandatory device function and cannot simply be forbidden (as in MID-051).\n\nA sandbox runtime provides only filtered and managed access to system resources. For example, an untrusted program will not have direct access to invoke kernel syscalls, read or write to files, access network interfaces, etc. The runtime can then provide only limited access to specific constrained resources governed by security policy, which can significantly reduce the risk of executing untrusted code. These protections will make lateral movement to different processes more difficult for malicious code running within a sandbox, as the code has no access to memory in those processes and has very little, to no, access to privileged function calls. Malicious code will be unable to access and manipulate data, memory, and code outside the sandbox without first finding and exploiting a vulnerability in the sandbox itself. Mobile devices running iOS and Android are a widely used example of this, running all applications in individual sandboxes to protect user data from malicious applications \\[1\\]\\[4\\]. Another example is the WebAssembly (WASM) format, initially developed to allow compiled code to safely execute in a sandbox within a web browser (similar to how JavaScript code is sandboxed) \\[5\\]. WASM use is growing in popularity for other environments, such as embedded systems, that can benefit from its portability and sandboxing properties \\[6\\]. This includes WASM runtimes optimized for embedded systems such as the Bytecode Alliance\u2019s WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) project \\[7\\].\n\nAdditionally, the abstraction provided by a sandbox can be used to prevent untrusted code from exploiting vulnerabilities that require low-level access to hardware (e.g., TID-103, TID-110). For example, in response to the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, web browsers deployed changes to their JavaScript engines to reduce the resolution of timers available to JavaScript code, reducing timer accuracy below the threshold necessary to successfully exploit the timing-based side channel \\[2\\]\\[3\\]. A similar change in Chromium-based browsers eliminates a form of RowHammer that researchers crafted using JavaScript and WebGL \\[2\\].",

            "description": "Some operating systems offer the ability to create containers that wrap small sets of applications in isolated partitions. Each container has its own view of system resources that is isolated from other containers and the host OS. Examples include Linux containers (LXC), Docker, BSD jails, etc. Container partitions are created by the host OS kernel which provides each container with isolated copies of various system resources, such as a unique guest filesystem, partitioned network stack, process ID space, user ID space, etc. Unlike virtualization (see MID-022), container systems do not need to provide virtualized views of hardware running separate full operating systems, instead abstracting at the level of a single kernel instance allows for lower performance overhead. However, OS kernels typically have a larger attack surface than a VM system\u2019s hypervisor, so containers are generally considered to be a weaker form of isolation than virtualization \\[2\\]. Device designers should consider risk vs performance tradeoffs when selecting which isolation technology to implement, although both technologies can used in parallel to achieve the desired balance.\n\nContainers offer several opportunities for security hardening. All the capabilities of MID-012 and MID-013 are available within each container partition. Furthermore, container filesystems can be stripped down to the bare minimum necessary for the applications within the container to function (see *MID-016 \u2013 Least Functionality*). So-called \u201crootless\u201d container design patterns can be employed such that all processes within a container context run with unprivileged non-root user permissions. Host-side orchestration tools like Docker, can enforce additional security restrictions over container contexts when they are created \\[1\\]. For example, seccomp syscall filters can be applied to each container to restrict what kernel interfaces any process within that container may access, which reduces the opportunities for container breakout attacks \\[4\\]. Finally, device developers may consider utilizing non-persistent or immutable (read-only) container image design patterns. These increase the difficulty for attackers to establish a foothold within a container while simplifying the process of restoring containers to a known-good state through restarting containers from an integrity-checked known-good state periodically or in response to indicators of compromise.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Containers can offer additional non-security benefits to device developers. The additional modularization they provide can make application development and maintenance more efficient, including making various devops practices more accessible to embedded device development workflows \\[6\\].",

Software compromises will be contained within a VM even if the threat actor can successfully exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability in the OS kernel within a given VM, protecting any code or data present in other VMs.\n\nHardware-assisted Virtual Machines (VMs) take advantage of CPU extensions that specifically support virtualization use cases to enforce strict separation between VMs\u2019 RAM and other resources. A hypervisor can utilize these CPU features to provide a high degree of assurance in that separation with relatively little performance overhead compared to a fully software-based VM scheme.

The hypervisor brokers the access guest VMs have to virtual and physical hardware resources and any support services implemented by the hypervisor itself. Because of its privilege level, the hypervisor must be hardened against comprise, a multi-faceted process that can involve multiple technical controls to increase hypervisor security.\n\nHypervisor-side software components that help implement hypervisor service APIs and the virtual hardware devices exposed to guest VMs should be isolated and sandboxed with minimal privileges to constrain any compromise of those components from spreading to more privileged domains within the hypervisor context. For example, in a hypervisor/host-OS combination based on Linux\u2019s KVM features, the software processes implementing each VM could be run with reduced privileges and under a restrictive SELinux policy \\[4\\].\n\nIn an embedded systems context, the configuration of the hypervisor and guest VMs is likely to be relatively static with no need to dynamically stop, start, or alter the configurations of VMs during runtime. In that case the hypervisor software and its configurations could be stored in immutable memory to the extent possible and only allowed to be changed as a result of the device\u2019s secure update mechanism.\n\nHypervisor software and data should also be integrated into the secure boot process to ensure its integrity before the device starts, as can be seen in *MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication*.

By virtue of virtual machines (VMs) being run on the same hardware, potential exploits and data leaks are present through hardware or device architecture vulnerabilities.\n\nEncrypting VMs and VM-related information can help maintain VM isolation in the presence of an untrustworthy hypervisor by keeping each VMs data confidential during execution. The added encryption makes it such that the VM\u2019s memory space is protected against unauthorized reads by the hypervisor or any other VM. Only undecipherable could be seen from any context other than the intended guest VM that memory belongs to.\n\nCloud computing uses cases are driving the adoption of these confidential computing features in newer processors. They build upon the RAM encryption functionality (described further in MID-065) that creates encrypted enclaves in memory associated with a particular execution context (thread, process, etc.) such that the contents of that memory are encrypted automatically by the CPU before being written to RAM and automatically decrypted when read in and placed in the CPU\u2019s cache and registers.",

            "description": "Firmware update mechanisms can provide a vector for threat actors to install malicious code, extract secrets from the firmware, or disrupt the device's availability. A secure firmware update mechanism must ensure the authenticity of the firmware, encrypt the file or communication channel, ensure updates cannot be triggered at inopportune times, and prevent rollback to insecure versions. Key functions of a secure firmware update are provided below.\n\n**1- Authenticity and Integrity**: The device should validate that the firmware update has not been tampered with before installing it on the device. The vendor should digitally sign the firmware using a protected private key, while the device should include an associated public key or public key hash to verify the signature scheme \\[1\\]. The digital signature should be computed across the entire firmware file. To sign a firmware image, the firmware signer should compute a hash of the firmware and run that hash through a signing software. The device can then take a hash of the firmware that it receives and use the public key to verify the signature from the signed hash to compare the two hash values \\[7\\].\n\n**2- Encryption**: Encrypting firmware in-transit and at-rest is an effective way to prevent adversaries from reverse engineering the firmware to extract secrets or discovering vulnerabilities.\n\n*At-rest*: If the firmware deployment requires firmware to be manually downloaded and transferred, stored on intermediary devices before reaching the target device, or stored anywhere on the device before loading into flash memory, then the firmware file should be encrypted. Encryption on-device could be implemented by encrypting all sections of the firmware and having the bootloader decrypt the firmware when it needs to be loaded. The bootloader would check the authenticity and integrity of the encrypted firmware, as mentioned in step 1, and then would decrypt the firmware if all the checks pass. The firmware would then be available for execution \\[8\\]\\[9\\].\n\n*In-transit*: If the firmware is deployed using an over-the-air update scheme (i.e., the firmware file will not reside on any intermediary systems), encryption should be provided by using an encrypted and authenticated communication protocol with public key-based authentication \\[9\\].\n\n**3- Update Initiation**: If a device can have its firmware update process initiated at any time, threat actors may be able to cause a denial-of-service attack against the device by initiating it at an unwanted time. To prevent these scenarios, all manually initiated firmware updates should only be initiated by authenticated and authorized privileged administrative users. In the event that the device is using automatic firmware updates, any requests to initiate the firmware update should go over an encrypted and authenticated protocol.\n\n**4- Rollback Protection**: Optionally, rollback protections can be added to the firmware update process to prevent threat actors from reinstalling an older, vulnerable version of firmware for future exploitation. Adding rollback protections are not always needed and may complicate device processes. See *MID-030 - Firmware Rollback Protections* for more information.\n\n**Additional Threats:** This mitigation depends on multiple cryptographic mechanisms, protocols, and keys, which are all potentially vulnerable to different threats (listed below), which should also be considered with the implemented solution.\n\n- TID-330 Cryptographic Timing Side-Channel\n\n- TID-214 Secrets Extracted from Device Root of Trust\n\n- TID-411 Weak/Insecure Cryptographic Protocol\n\n- TID-318 Insecure Cryptographic Implementation\n\n- TID-317 Predictable Cryptographic Key",

These are libraries that have been examined, tested, and vetted for safety, security, and protection against side-channels by independent laboratories according to industry approved specifications. Building cryptographic libraries is a complex and difficult process that oftentimes results in libraries that have issues either with the generation or processing of cryptographic primitives or the processing of implemented algorithms over the input data.\n\nAdditionally, if any of the above issues do arise, using libraries that aren\u2019t validated and aren\u2019t maintained could lead to vulnerabilities persisting while fixes are developed.

Hardware-backed keystores leverage dedicated hardware and hardware abstraction layers to provide security features, such as storing a root-of-trust, keys, certificates or sensitive data. Hardware-backed keystores can take different forms and can be integrated with various functionalities, such as secure elements, TPMs, or cryptographic coprocessors to offer more secure key management.

For example, 1<sup>st</sup> stage bootloader code stored in a hardware RoTs can be used to check firmware or later-stage bootloader authenticity and integrity before installing and running. This then allows the device to have a degree of certainty that the low-level code it is running is secure.\n\nUsually, a hardware RoT consists of cryptographic keys and minimal boot code that uses the keys to ensure that the next piece of code is trusted to run.

If the RoT can never be changed, then threat actors cannot manipulate it to perform malicious actions. However, if a RoT is immutable and a vulnerability is found in the code stored within it, there are no ways to patch the device (see TID-220).

            "description": "To deploy firmware rollback protections, devices need to take steps to ensure that once new firmware has been deployed and is confirmed to be operational on the device, older firmware cannot be deployed again. There are many ways to handle increasing firmware version numbers, with two implementations being an automatic update on reset and an update on command.\n\n\u201cAutomatic update on reset\u201d \\[1\\] involves the Boot ROM updating the anti-rollback reference version when a newer version has been successfully loaded. To reach a success stage, the new image must pass all secure boot checks, such as the authenticity and integrity checks in *MID-026 - Secure Firmware Update.* This method gives no window of attack for threat actors trying to rollback firmware between updates and firmware success, however it also means that if there are errors in the firmware the user cannot revert to the last-known-good copy. Vendors themselves however can still rollback to a previous version by repackaging the firmware and distributing it with new version numbers \\[1\\].\n\n\u201cUpdate on command\u201d \\[1\\] involves the anti-rollback reference version being updated in response to a secure message from an authorized management service. The previous version is therefore revoked only after the device management service signals that the newer version has no identified faults. This means that the device will be able to revert to an earlier version of the firmware before they receive the final message. While this gives users increased flexibility because they can choose to accept or reject firmware after trying it out, it also means that devices are left vulnerable during the window between firmware update and when the secure message is received. Additionally, this method may leave devices vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack that can be initiated by blocking the secure completion message. The device will therefore never accept the firmware and won\u2019t begin operations \\[1\\].\n\n<u>Consideration</u>: If an attacker can spoof the anti-rollback references to increment the versions, the device could be rendered inoperable. Vendors must ensure that only authorized software is able to update the anti-rollback references. See *MID-026 - Secure Firmware Update* for more information. Given the risks and challenges in creating a resilient rollback protection feature, device designers should carefully consider whether this mitigation is appropriate for their use case before pursuing it.",

When a device receives a message, it checks the nonce to make sure that the nonce is still valid, and if it is, it will accept the message. If the nonce is no longer valid, the device will know that the same message was sent to them multiple times, potentially indicating a replay attack, and will reject the message.\n\nThe first nonce in a communication is oftentimes sent in the first message by the device that is initiating the communication. The nonce will then undergo some operation that both the sender and receiver know. Subsequently, in every message the device will receive a transmission with a nonce, perform the operation, and send the new nonce in the next message. This results in a situation where every message has a unique nonce and the sender and receiver can know what the next nonce will be in advance, but the adversary cannot derive it as they do not know the operation or initial nonce.\n\nNonces can sometimes be implemented alongside *MID-037 - Network Timestamps* to give devices time windows and unique message identifiers to work with. If the device is not using a timestamp, it will have to ensure that the nonce is it using is sufficiently large or random so that it cannot be guessed. If it can be guessed, it may be possible for threat actors to send malicious messages with valid nonces. For example, if a device uses a counter as the initial nonce and adding one as its operation, it may be possible for a threat actor to guess the next number in sequence. A random-number generator with a hashing function on the other hand would produce results that are much harder to guess.",

            "description": "For programmable devices like PLCs, signing programs gives the device the ability to ensure that the programs that they are installing and running originate from a verified source. If the programs are not signed, it may be possible for a threat actor to install malicious programs that alter device behavior.\n\nDevices can enable these capabilities by allowing the device to accept, store, and use verifying keys to verify that a program is signed. If the program is not signed, the device should automatically reject the new program and send out an alert.\n\nUsers should be able to generate signing and verifying keys (public and private asymmetric keys) and send the verifying key to downstream devices that will be receiving programs. Programs can then be signed, either by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or another signing mechanism and distributed to the device for verification and deployment.\n\n<u>Note</u>: This mitigation is heavily dependent on the security of the source of the programs/application. Many devices, such as PLCs, require the deployment of custom programs that are developed individually at each organization.\n\n<u>Limitation</u>: This would require a dedicated signing key to be deployed within the IDE and a verifying key within the end device. Ideally this would be a unique signing key for every organization, however, this would require each organization to perform the key initialization and exchange with each new IDE or device. This scheme gets more complex as typically there are many IDEs within an organization that may need to deploy programs to a device, further organizations need to perform key escrow to store keys, otherwise if the IDEs and associated keys are lost, they will be unable to deploy programs to the device. If organizational keys are not used, and the same signing key is used across an entire product line, a threat actor may be able to extract this key from the IDE (such as through reverse engineering) and then use it to sign an unauthorized program.",

Network communications, user authentication handshakes, data protection, and other protocols are implemented using cryptographic algorithms and operations to protect information and achieve other desired security guarantees. Devices should implement protocols that are widely used, well tested, verified for security assurances, and utilize strong cryptographic algorithms. Examples of these are WPA3 and TLS.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Chosen protocols should incorporate anti-metadata analysis features such as packet length standardization, packet frequency standardization, header length standardization, etc. Overall, packet metadata shouldn't be able to be used to derive the contents of encrypted messages.

A lockout would instead lock the device so that no more authentication attempts can be made after a certain amount of password attempts were performed. Lockouts present risks to the device because devices will be unusable until the lockout is lifted, meaning that a denial-of-service-type effect is possible. This lockout can be lifted either through some authenticated administrative process and/or by requiring physical presence on the device (see *MID-031 - Physical Presence Validation* for more information).",

            "description": "To create sufficiently random keys, devices need a source of data with a high degree of entropy to ensure that the keys are not predictable. If a device does not have a source of sufficient entropy and tries to create a key, it may be possible that the inputs that seeded the key or pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) can be guessed and therefore threat actors may be able to recreate the key or predict the PRNG output. By using a high degree of entropy, keys and seeds are fully random and cannot be recreated by threat actors, thereby making them cryptographically stronger.\n\nDevices typically feed their entropy pools by collecting the unpredictable least significant bits from device events like the absolute and relative timing between things like hardware interrupts, user input, and other similarly unpredictable events. Complex devices like desktop and server PCs can rely on plentiful sources of such events. Embedded devices often do not have as rich a set of hardware, may have no direct interactive user input, fewer processes and applications executing, and are generally more regular and constrained in their actions. This can result in embedded systems having a shallower pool of entropy to draw upon when the need to generate cryptographic keys arises.\n\nOperations that consume data from an entropy pool to generate keys of seed PRNGs must wait until a sufficient quantity is available. To avoid (potentially long) pauses in operation, especially at boot up, some devices have been known to use non-blocking sources, and as a result the keys they generated were predictable and vulnerable to attack. To remain secure, devices should use a blocking entropy pool that waits until there is sufficient entropy to fulfill the request for random numbers. If the device doesn\u2019t have a way to generate enough entropy on first boot, devices may require mechanisms to obtain additional sufficient entropy (e.g. ask for random user inputs). If that is not practical, the design may need to be modified to include a cryptographic quality hardware-based random number generator (see *MID-048 - Hardware Random Number Generator* and *MID-060 - Dedicated Hardware Cryptographic Modules*).\n\n<u>Note</u>: Using sufficiently random keys is an important part of maintaining the security guarantees that a good cryptographic algorithm will provide.

Since these devices use local data that is constantly varying to create their random numbers, it is very difficult to recreate the environment in which the number was generated. Therefore, hardware random number generators can be used to create keys that have a high degree of entropy for their seeds and themselves have a high degree of randomness.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Implementors should be sure to verify that the hardware RNG they are considering produces a random stream of sufficient cryptographic quality for use in key generation and not simply a hardware implementation of a lower quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm.",

            "description": "Passwords should be stored only in a non-reversible salted and hashed format that is calculated by a cryptographically strong hashing algorithm. Hashing algorithms are one-way algorithms that can turn data into a unique fixed-length string representation of that data. Since this algorithm is one-way, data that is hashed cannot be turned back into its cleartext form, meaning that threat actors who come across hashed passwords have to try to hash every password combination until they have a match.\n\nThreat actors have been known to use pre-calculated lookup tables of hashed potential password values to accelerate the password guessing process. Salting can prevent this from happening by increasing the required size of the lookup tables to make this approach to guessing impractical. Salts are pieces of random data that are appended to the password before hashing and then are stored with the hashed password. What this does is make the password hash unique because the password is actually the password + the hashed data. Therefore, this password cannot be found in a hash lookup table, but the salted hash can still be calculated by the device within an acceptably short time bound.",

This includes dedicated memory debug interfaces (e.g., JTAG), UART serial ports that expose sensitive data or command shells, or any similar port. These ports should be disabled in hardware (preferably) by engaging security fuses or at least in software. Simply depopulating physical headers on device circuit boards is not sufficient. Ideally, such ports should be disabled permanently, but if some degree of diagnostic capability is desired for production devices, reenabling one of these ports should be an authenticated administrative action.",

Countermeasures can be organized into three categories: *hiding* (reducing the leakage and adding noise), *masking* (disassociating leakage from sensitive values, and by protocol (e.g., limiting the usage of sensitive values like cryptographic keys). Example techniques include designing computations to be independent of sensitive values from a time or power perspective, balancing the operations on either side of conditional statements, using unpredictable ordering for bit or byte test and comparison operations, adding randomness or noise, and limiting secret key reuse.",

Dedicated cryptographic modules can implement hardware-based defenses that are not possible in a software library. In processor-constrained designs, hardware acceleration of cryptographic algorithms can enable implementing stronger algorithms and key sizes than may be practical in a software-only solution. As with software cryptographic libraries, implementors should prefer modules that have been examined, tested, and vetted by independent laboratories according to industry approved specifications. Modules should also be evaluated for their protection against side channel attacks, especially based on power consumption and electromagnetic emittance.\n\n<u>Note</u>: This has several important distinctions from *MID-028 -* *Hardware-backed Key Storage.* In the MID-028 case, key material may reside in hardware-backed or hardware-based storage, but the hardware lacks the means to perform cryptographic operations using that key without exposing it to the system\u2019s processor.

Avoid separating security decisions (e.g., authorization checks, signature validations) from the data and operations they govern; doing so can introduce weaknesses that allow bypassing those checks.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Adding additional processors to separate device functions and data necessarily increases the complexity and cost of the device\u2019s hardware and software.

            "description": "Many software-based mitigations to fault injection have been imposed. These range from coding patterns and strategies that can be used at development time, to automated compiler-based techniques, and hybrid approaches that take advantage of hardware features.\n\nCertain programming patterns can harden pieces of code against common faults \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\]. Redundancy is one such pattern, i.e., performing certain comparisons, memory reads, or function calls multiple times and comparing the results. Others include: choosing constant flag values with a large Hamming distance between them that are hard for a fault to generate or flip between, (e.g., multi-byte random bit strings instead of 0 and 1); adding code checks for \u2018impossible\u2019 paths through logic trees that could only be reached as a result of a fault; adding random time delays to operations; checking that loops executed to completion without stopping early; etc.\n\nOther research has proposed more systematic approaches to hardening code at compile time. As compile-time approaches must be automated and generally applicable to all code, they often implement more narrow protections against specific types of faults. Examples include automating the insertion of duplicate computations and comparisons throughout an application \\[4\\] or hardening the control flow of loops \\[5\\]. Instruction duplication (ID) is one commonly proposed technique that can be automatically applied \\[6\\]\\[7\\], however it has been shown over time that ID is only effective against faults that skip single instructions \\[8\\]\\[9\\]. An attacker that can coordinate multiple faults to target each duplication can likely still achieve their objective. \\[13\\] demonstrates that such coordination is feasible with readily accessible tools.\n\nOther general-purpose protections that protect a program\u2019s control flow graph, e.g., control flow integrity (CFI), can provide some protection against faults that alter function pointers and jump addresses similar to how a software exploit would. Software-based CFI schemes \\[10\\]\\[11\\] and hardware-assisted schemes (e.g., using ARM pointer authentication) \\[12\\] have been explored. See MID-407 and MID-020 for more information on CFI and pointer authentication/encryption.\n\nA combination of multiple hardware and software-based mitigation techniques (see MID-062) to address the range of fault injection types, as recommended by \\[3\\], can prove more effective than any individual mitigation.",

            "description": "As DRAM densities increase and cell sizes shrink, they become increasingly vulnerable to RowHammer-style attacks. Since its discovery, many solutions have been proposed in the research community to varying degrees of success \\[1\\]. ECC memory can provide some protection against single bit errors, but multi-bit flip RowHammer variants have been demonstrated that exceed ECC\u2019s ability to correct \\[2\\]. ECC-detectable single bit errors may occur during an attempted RowHammer and provide indication to a firmware or operating system-level mitigation that an attack is underway.\n\nNewer DRAM specifications have introduced defenses, such as DDR4\u2019s Target Row Refresh (TRR) mechanism, that have made a successful RowHammer attack more difficult. However, attack methods have been refined to achieve success even on TRR-enabled DRAMs \\[3\\]. Not all DRAM modules are equally susceptible, and the memory controllers built into processors have implemented defenses of various efficacy. In \\[3\\], the authors show how to test the performance of a particular combination.\n\nJEDEC updated the DDR5 specification in 2024 (JESD79-5C) to add Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC) \\[4\\]. PRAC-enabled DRAM chips track individual DRAM row activations and signal the memory controller when the count exceeds a threshold value indicating a potential victim row requires a refresh that the controller must then command. Recent research concludes that PRAC does mitigate a RowHammer-style attack in many cases, although is subject to potentially high performance and energy overheads \\[5\\].\n\nIf the CPU/SoC\u2019s memory controller supports it, system firmware and device operating system could cooperate with the memory controller hardware to leverage indicators from ECC, PRAC, etc. to inform additional layers of mitigation, such as identifying and terminating the offending application process conducting the RowHammer attack \\[6\\].",

            "description": "Applying cryptographic solutions to inter-chip and inter-peripheral data bus messaging can protect against data interception and modification. A message authentication code (MAC) scheme can be sufficient to protect the integrity of bus data from manipulation, but a more complete encryption scheme is required to maintain confidentiality. More complex chips (e.g., microcontrollers) will often be needed on either end of the communication that have specialized support for pairing, key management, message authentication codes, and encryption. Additionally, the extra overhead of adding encryption often requires migrating to newer, more capable bus protocols that support encryption, for examples CAN-FD vs. CAN \\[1\\]. On the higher end of performance, the PCI SIG is developing the Integrity and Data Encryption feature for inclusion in a future version of the PCIe bus specification \\[2\\].\n\nApple\u2019s TouchID fingerprint authentication mechanism incorporates an example of this mitigation \\[3\\]. The device\u2019s TouchID fingerprint sensor and the Secure Enclave chip are provisioned with a unique shared key at manufacturing time. This key is used to negotiate an additional session key that encrypts and authenticates the sensor data as it passes between the two chips.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Many common PCB-level bus and interconnect protocols do not support encryption or authentication. Restricting a device design to components that do have these features may be a too limiting or too costly constraint. Device pairing and key management mechanisms and processes are necessary, add complexity to device design and manufacturing, especially to implement unique keys on each device (see MID-033).",

Encoding outputs ensures that all outputted variables on the web application are converted into text before displaying. Encoded or escaped text will not execute on the user\u2019s browser, making the variables safe for display. For example, putting quotes around variables, using escape sequences, using encoding formats for special characters like single or double quotes, and putting displayed variables in safe HTML or CSS structures can all help to prevent code execution upon output. These controls should be used when the user has the ability to edit any HTML on the webpage.\n\nPotential ways to sanitize HTML input include using the JavaScript DOMPurify.sanitize() function and storing variables in safe structures or \u201csafe sinks\u201d. Safe sinks are HTML structures that will always treat the stored variable as text and therefore will never execute it.\n\n<u>Note</u>: It is best to use web application frameworks that have this functionality already built-in and have been well tested and are widely used.",

Methods can include 1) only executing prepared statements with parameterized queries, 2) only executing stored procedures, and 3) allow-list input validation \\[1\\].\n\nPrepared statements with parameterized queries change the way that the web app will process a user request and form a query. When using prepared statements, the web app that processes the user data will take the user data and place it into a pre-defined section of the query, with the rest of the query already formed. Therefore, the actual SQL commands that the database will be executing are handled and compiled before the user input is processed and inserted, so the user input cannot introduce any new potentially malicious commands. This is then coupled with parameterized variables, where variables are set to be a certain type before being inserted into the SQL statement to ensure that no variable can be misconstrued as a command and not a string, for example.\n\nStored procedures are procedures that are crafted and pre-stored on the web app. They can be sent to the SQL database upon prompting from the client to the web app. Since these statements are pre-crafted and stored before the client has any interaction with the web app, the client cannot send custom queries that may be malicious. Assuming that the user data is parameterized here as well, users will not be able to inject data into the query that will not be interpreted as a literal data type. Therefore, the threat surface is lowered because the stored procedures can be implemented safely, and user input will not be able to add any new commands.\n\nAllow-list input validation is implemented by creating an allow-list of parameters for clients to choose from. This allow list can be implemented through conditionals like *if*\u2026*else* and *switch* statements. This would prevent potential commands contained in user inputs from being a part of the final SQL query statement given to the database.\n\n<u>Limitation</u>: If a device is using stored procedures, particular care needs to be made to what permissions the stored procedure executor has. If the device has device-level users, the user that executes the procedures may need a high-level of permissions, which could make that user a target to threat actors.",

This can prevent threat actors from inserting alternative paths (e.g., using relative directory names or symlinks) that map to the target file but that the device was not expecting, which may result in bypassing file access control policies.

The effect is magnified when asymmetries exist allowing small messages, which are inexpensive for an attacker to generate, lead to expensive response processing on the device.\n\nTechnical mechanisms to implement this mitigation can include timeout functions that will return/cancel request processing after a set amount of time after the request is made, limiting the overall bandwidth that a device will process, constraining the number of active connections a device will support, instituting request queue management and prioritization, or separating request handler code paths so that resource limits can be imposed on them. These mechanisms can work together to ensure that the network protocol handlers and services remain responsive, and that no one handler, or source of traffic, can monopolize all system processing resources.\n\nIf protocol designs allow for it, expensive operations should not be performed as a result of unauthenticated or pre-authentication messages (*MID-034 - Authenticate Network Traffic)*, constraining threat actors\u2019 access to easily access the most exhaustible resources.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Device creators should take care to ensure that the processing limits do not become the target of denial-of-service attacks themselves. For example, if a device only allows one connection at a time, threat actors may try to occupy that connection, preventing legitimate users from communicating.\n\n<u>Limitation</u>: Device-level mitigations cannot cope with flooding attacks that simply overwhelm the bandwidth capacity of the device\u2019s network link. In this case, upstream network devices must impose appropriate rate limits.",

These added features make sending spoofed, illegitimate, or replayed messages more difficult.\n\nTo enable secure network tunnels, both the sending and receiving device must be compatible with the secure tunnel protocol and the underlying wrapped protocol. If the devices themselves cannot be made compatible with the wrapping protocol, a dedicated gateway device can be placed between the incompatible device and upstream network to implement the tunnel.

            "description": "Exporting logs over the network to a network-accessible server can decrease the ability for threat actors to impact device owner/defender via log manipulation. For example, a threat actor that can manipulate logs on the device after they are logged and placed into an on-device database will not necessarily be able to manipulate the logs that are sent over the network, as long as they are sent before they can be edited by a user in the database. Therefore, threat actors that are trying to hide their tracks or confuse defenders looking at these logs will not be able to completely blind defenders to the actions on their device. Also, by storing logs on a separate server, device owners can cross-reference on-device logs with server-stored logs to check for discrepancies during routine or automated device audits. A discrepancy will likely lead to the discovery of device failure or malicious behavior.\n\n<u>Consideration</u>: Sending data over the network to be logged comes with non-security engineering tradeoffs. One benefit is that by logging data over the network devices don\u2019t have to worry about on-device storage limitations. The device can store a limited number of relevant logs (say, the past 200 events) and the rest of the historical data can be viewed on the logging server. Some downsides of remote logging though include having to worry about network bandwidth capabilities, available processing power, and battery life. However, some IoT platforms-as-a-service have features that can make the logging and storing of logs process easier.\n\n<u>Note</u>: Exporting logs over the network will mean that the device has property *PID-41: Device exposes remote network services*, and therefore the device should take into account threats related to PID-41 and its applicable sub-properties.",

            "description": "A lack of authenticating program memory accesses, coupled with insecure code, can give threat actors near total control over a program or machine. Threat actors can gain this control by acquiring the ability to change memory locations that a given pointer points to, manipulate return addresses that functions are jumping to (such as in a ROP attack), or alter underlying memory itself from otherwise forbidden processes.\n\nAuthenticating program memory access using hardware backed features, such as hardware-backed capabilities, can prevent this behavior. Capabilities are a way to address memory where pointers are replaced with a new data structure, called a capability, that holds both an address and access rights metadata such as read/write permissions and permissible memory bounds. This is sometimes done by physically extending register space, or by creating abstracted virtual registers consisting of 2 physical registers.\n\nCapabilities can give an operating system memory bounds checking, memory access control, and pointer integrity checking. In the event that one of these protections are violated, the program will trap to the OS or will throw a well-defined error. Backing this enforcement in hardware involves extending these protections through methods like extending physical memory address registers, to give extra room for the capability metadata, or enforcing the memory accesses using dedicated instructions or processors so they cannot be changed in software.\n\nOne example of this can be seen by the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) capability model. CHERI achieves memory protection by using a capability coprocessor, which defines compiler-managed capability registers, and tagged memory, which protects in-memory capabilities. OSes then leverage both of these features with some custom instructions (called the CHERI ISA) to implement hardware-backed capability addressing. CHERI enables the enforcement of these memory addresses by having the OS tag the physical memory address register before it is translated to a virtual memory address, ensuring that the register address cannot be tampered with after creation. The OS can then use the dedicated CHERI instructions to check that a given memory access matches the permissions found in the capability metadata. If the check is successful, then the access continues, otherwise, the OS will reject the access and fail gracefully.",

            "description": "Formal verification is the process of proving, typically with an aid of automated or semi-automated tooling, that a particular code module or function satisfies the desired requirements. Depending on the size and complexity of the code to be verified, formal verification can be a time-consuming effort requiring significant expertise. One way developers to leverage formal verification at lower cost is to use pre-existing code that has already been formally verified.\n\nCritical security functions of a device\u2019s OS kernel that have undergone formal verification have been inter-process communication (IPC), hardware interactions, managing the kernel stack and data spaces, handling process interrupts, and more. One example of a formally verified microkernel is seL4, whose implementation on ARM and RISCV64 has proofs demonstrating that the proper use of the kernel will enforce integrity and confidentiality, which are core security properties. What this means in the case of seL4 is that the kernel will always operate in a predictable way in accordance with its specification, and never in any other way. Since its specification guarantees process separation and inter-process tamper protection, users can be sure that this will never occur on their kernel.\n\nWhile formally verified microkernels can be used as traditional kernels, with userspace processes running on top of the kernel, they can also be used as a hypervisor for the device. When used as a hypervisor, the microkernel will run a virtualized environment as a dedicated set of processes, with the virtualized environment likely having its own kernel and userspace. This allows for a more traditional operating system to be run on devices using microkernels in instances where the traditional OS\u2019s functionality is required, but with the added benefit of isolating the environment from other processes on the device (such as other virtual environments or dedicated processes).\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Only properties that were scoped into the formal OS kernel specification, verification, and/or generator can be guaranteed to be in the resulting OS kernel, and only for the versions of a kernel compiled with specific configuration options and when running on specific hardware configurations. Kernels like seL4 often have a number of optional features and can run on hardware configurations that would invalidate the formal proof. Users will need carefully check the assumptions.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: While a formally verified kernel would ensure certain properties (such as information flow isolation), these will need to be meaningfully leveraged in the system design in order to provide the desired value. For example, a system design that places all software into a single userspace partition under seL4 would not benefit from seL4\u2019s theoretical capability to isolate partitions. Another design that sets up two partitions but then creates channels allowing the two partitions to communicate in unrestricted fashion, would not fare much better.\n\n<u>Consideration:</u> A strong design would often combine a formally verified microkernel, isolating critical functionality into separate partitions, then making sure the code in those partitions is itself formally verified (see MID-089), or at least implemented using a memory-safe programming language (see MID-005) with cross-partition and external communication channels filtered by formally verified parsers (see MID-088).",

            "description": "Parsers frequently have vulnerabilities that threat actors can exploit with malicious inputs. These can include parsers for the network protocol messages being ingested and/or the underlying data contained in that protocol, such as an incoming file, document, or other structured payloads. Exploits may take advantage of memory issues such as double-fetch memory calls, buffer overflows, and array out-of-bounds accesses. Another common weakness is a so-called \u201cparser differentials\u201d, where the attacker can exploit mismatches in behavior between two parsers for the same language. To avoid the presence of vulnerabilities, parser creators can use formal verification to ensure the functional correctness of the parsers with regard to a particular formal definition of the format.\n\nIn general, formal verification is the process of proving, typically with an aid of automated or semi-automated tooling, that a particular code module or function satisfies the desired requirements. Depending on the size and complexity of the code to be verified, formal verification can be a time-consuming effort requiring significant expertise. One way for developers to leverage formal verification at lower cost is to use pre-existing code and libraries that has already been formally verified, or to leverage tooling that can generate \u201ccorrect-by-construction\u201d code from specifications.\n\nFortunately, formally verified parser generators already exist. In addition to ensuring correctness, the formal verification of parsers typically provides significant security guarantees, such as guaranteeing memory and type safety, and preventing deadlock states and crashes. As a result, parser implementors and users can be sure that they will not have bugs or vulnerabilities in their code. Formally verified parsers therefore can be trusted to reject improperly structured inputs as defined by the parser specification. For example, they can be trusted to not have buffer overflows that could cause arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities when verified with respect to memory safety. Moreover, formally verified parsers can be trusted to produce a well-formed output, where each data item would have the expected size and type, thereby protecting downstream code from the effects of malicious inputs.\n\nA best practice to create trustworthy network parsers is by using formally verified parser generators that will either use formal tooling to prove their output correct, or have already been verified to always produce correct results. Generally, use of these generators involves creating a specification to describe a protocol and then feeding that specification through the generator. The generator will output usable code, assembly, and/or binaries. By having developers only create a specification, but not actually write code themselves, assurances can be provided that the final code has undergone the formal verification process and is functionally correct with regard to the specified format. Therefore, it will be free of any potential for undefined behaviors, no matter how malicious the input. Often the same protocol formal specification can be used to generate parsers in different programming languages for multiple environments, helping to ensure that different implementations will act consistently and eliminating the potential for parser differential vulnerabilities.\n\n<u>Considerations</u>: Unlike most other uses of formal methods, the use of formally verified parser generators typically does not require any special expertise. It does however require capturing the target format(s) in a formal (mathematically precise) definition, which can sometimes be fulfilled in a specification for a generator. While this process can be time-consuming, it can typically be a beneficial action in its own right, as it removes any ambiguities that are almost certainly present in any less-formal specifications, such as those written in natural languages.\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Only properties that were scoped into the specification and/or generator verification of the parser can be guaranteed to be in the resulting parser. Errors and vulnerabilities may still occur on the boundary of the formally verified code. If any changes, even seemingly trivial ones, are made to the generated code (such as to optimize performance), all guarantees provided by the formal methods tooling are invalidated.",

            "description": "In general, formal verification is the process of proving, typically with an aid of automated or semi-automated tooling, that a particular code module or function satisfies the desired requirements. Depending on the size and complexity of the code to be verified, formal verification can be a time-consuming effort requiring significant expertise. In general, it is significantly easier to verify code that was explicitly designed with formal verification in mind.\n\nFormal verification is capable of eliminating broad classes of software bugs and vulnerabilities, providing otherwise-unprecedented levels of certainty in software correctness and security. By forcing the software designers to consider implications of their design decisions, the use of formal methods often leads to \u201ccleaner\u201d more maintainable designs. In attempting to prove that a property holds, formal verification forces developers to confront and fix all the reasons the property might be violated early in software development process, eliminating costly rework that would have been needed should the errors were left undetected much further into the system development timeline.\n\nA general approach to considering formal verification for a particular system may be outlined as follows. First, what are the most critical functions in the system that are particularly important to implement correctly in order to achieve the desired system-level goals? Note that this may include both the functions directly producing the end-goal functionality for the system, the protection mechanisms for end-goal functionality, or something else. Second, are there existing formally verified implementations (see MID-087) or tools (see MID-088) for that functionality that can be leveraged? If not, what is the formal tooling that may be necessary for establishing the desired properties of the implementations \u2013 model-based code synthesis tools, model checkers, interactive theorem provers, or something else? From there, the process often becomes use-case specific, necessitating inputs from domain experts and formal verification experts to choose the right path forward.\n\n<u>Consideration:</u> A strong design will often combine a formally verified microkernel (see MID-087), isolating critical functionality into separate partitions, making sure the code in those partitions is itself formally verified as discussed above, and then ensuring cross-partition and external communication channels are filtered by formally verified parsers (see MID-088).\n\n<u>Limitations</u>: Only properties that were scoped into the formal specification, verification, and/or generator can be guaranteed to carry through into the resulting implementation. Users need to make sure their specifications are complete enough and specific enough to exclude all undesired behaviors. Additionally, users should be aware of the assumptions made in the definition of the specification as any violations of those assumptions would invalidate the proofs and make any conclusions made by the formal verification inapplicable.",
